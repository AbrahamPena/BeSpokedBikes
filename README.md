# BeSpokedBikes
Sales tracking application 

Welcome to the BeSpoked Bikes demo. Feel free to ignore the login page and just click on login. It should take you to a blank default page.
The connectionstring will probably need to be changed in order for it to work properly. Speaking of database, when running the scripts to create the tables,
it is best to run the BikeStyle, and Manufacturer first. Products, salesperson, and customer next and sales and discount last. This is mainly done due to the fact
that some foreign keys are present.
